# student-form


This project is a simple web-based student form created using HTML. It allows users to enter and manage student information through a user-friendly interface.

#Features
Form to collect student details:

Name

Age

Gender

Course (with predefined options)

Displays submitted student records in a structured table

Option to delete individual records from the table

#Technologies Used
HTML for page structure

CSS (inside a <style> tag) for basic styling

JavaScript (inside a <script> tag) for handling form submission and data management

#How It Works
Users fill out the form with the required student details and submit it. The submitted data appears in a table below the form, where each record can be individually deleted. All interactions are handled within a single HTML file using embedded CSS and JavaScript.

#Usage
To use the form, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. Fill in the required information and submit the form. You can view added records and delete them as needed.
